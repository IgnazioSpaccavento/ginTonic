=== MAIN QUERY FIND DEBUG ===
Query: 'AAT', max_forks: -1, cache: NO
Using default bootstrap (no cache)
Calling gin_gin_query_find_bootstrapped with bootstrap_depth=2

=== BOOTSTRAPPED QUERY DEBUG ===
Bootstrap depth: 2, Initial forks: 1

--- Iteration 0 (t=2) ---
Forks before step: 1
Using double rank step

=== DOUBLE RANK FORK & COMPACT DEBUG ===
Query: AAT (position t=2)
Current forks count: 1

--- Double Rank Fork 0 ---
  Current fork range: [38, 42) at position 1
  Character at position 1: 'A'
  After double rank advance: fork=[32, 33), precedence=[3, 6)
  Precedence range size: 3
  Querying IMT with range [2, 4]
  IMT returned 1 intervals (R ranges):
    R[0]: [1, 1] -> SA range [7, 8) (pos=1)
  Total new forks created: 1

Before compaction: 1 new forks
New forks before compaction:
  Fork[0]: [7, 8)
After compaction: 1 merged forks
Merged forks after compaction:
  Merged[0]: [7, 8)
Forks after step: 2, Partial matches: 0
